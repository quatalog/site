    "description" : "Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations.

The interdependence among building materials, acoustic qualities, enclosure systems, interior, finish, and other systems is investigated, with an emphasis on the broader architectural design endeavor. An understand of assemblies and integration is developed both from a design and engineering perspective as well as in construction application. Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in class presentations, project work, field trips, and case studies. Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed.",

    "description" : "Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

In continuing the inquiry begun in The Ethos of Architecture and employing the skills and values acquired in that course and Architectural Media, the intent of this course is to teach students the means for investigating buildings coherently, rationally, and interpretively to understand the technical and cultural knowledge embedded within works of architecture. A select number of modern and contemporary buildings that represent a high degree of sophistication in the way their architects have approached the breadth of design issues both within and external to the programs of those works will be analyzed critically in order to ascertain the significance and relationships of the multiple systems of order inherent to a work of architecture.",

First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises . Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer. B.S. and B.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

In addition, researchers also leverage computing power to describe, model, and predict dynamic behaviors that could otherwise not be perceived in such large-scale omics data. Along with these topics, students will learn to critically read current scientific literature. A student cannot get credit for both BCBP 4660 / BIOL 4660 and BCBP 6650 / BIOL 6650 .",

The course introduces numerous families of natural polymers from sources such as plant cell walls, rubber trees, grains, crustacean exoskeletons, fungal cell walls, microbial fermentation, seaweed, seeds, silkworms, spiders, and animals. Applications of natural polymers and their modified forms that will be discussed include but are not limited to, thickeners, biodegradable plastics, medical materials, fibers in composites, nanoparticles, antimicrobials, and cosmetic ingredients.",

Instead, it has emerged as a central collection of skills aimed at how to get the right information to the right people at the right time, in a usable form. It has as much to do with information architecture, knowledge management, and information design as with writing reports and instructions. In addition, RPI has a long-standing heritage in technical communication, as the first academic degree in the field was offered here.

Traditionally, these choices have been framed as how to best employ scarce resources to produce goods and services and distribute them for consumption. To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.",

As a result, accurate predictions of the future are critical for the public and private sector alike. This course introduces students to the empirical techniques used by professional economists in business , government and financial sectors to model the complex processes generating data through time and to make real world forecasts. The steps and methods required to develop a forecast-from understanding the properties of time-series data to forecast evaluation-are defined. Topics include modeling trends, seasonality and cycles, ARMA and ARIMA models, forecast combination, vector-autoregression, and nonlinear methods. All these topics and the relevant techniques will be illustrated using economic and financial data.",

The design document and literature review may pull from disciplines that contribute to game design, including, but not limited to, Visual Arts, Humanities and Media Studies, Social Science, Psychology, and Computer Science. The student will be advised by a member of the GSAS faculty. A committee of the student's advisor, a second GSAS faculty member, and a third faculty member from outside the program or Institution will approve the student's Master's Proposal document, which contains the literature review and design proposal, and is to be completed no later than the end of the first Master's semester.",

In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.",
