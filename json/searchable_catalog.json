From this fundamental point of departure, the course will examine the construction systems as a composition of building elements (walls, floors, columns, etc.) as well construction methods (casting, laminating, bending, stacking, connecting). Additional coursework will analyze enclosure systems and building envelopes that extend the structural system or attach to it, creating an interior to control and mediate between external environmental factors and internal programmatic requirements.",

The course establishes an understanding of the most common building materials including their physical properties, appropriate applications, and the implications of their uses in the larger context of embodied energy and material life cycles. Complementing performance characteristics, the phenomenology of materials is introduced as a key concept in architectural design. The performance of material assemblies, as synergy between form and material properties, is explored through analysis of architectural case studies. Design experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. These experiments take the form of digital simulations and constructed scale models, with student documentation and reflection on their design processes. Students will study and analyze structural and material strategies in built works, communicating their findings through language, images, drawings, and diagrams.

    "description" : "Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises. Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto their laptop computer.",

To fully appreciate the complexity of living systems, researchers gather systematic, quantitative measurements of a system\u2019s components using cutting-edge omics techniques. In addition, researchers also leverage computing power to describe, model, and predict dynamic behaviors that could otherwise not be perceived in such large-scale omics data. Along with these topics, students will learn to critically read current scientific literature. .",

Muscle structure and function will be explored at the protein, single fiber, and whole tissue levels. Discussions will focus primarily on skeletal muscle, and topics will include muscle morphology, cross-bridge theory, molecular motor and actomyosin interaction, Hill-type and Huxley-type models, electromyography, fatigue, muscle inhibition, history-dependent phenomena, in vitro and in vivo muscle function, and the response to injury. Each topic will be introduced and developed utilizing seminal articles in the literature as well as excerpts from texts, and further discussion on current problems and state-of-the-art experimental techniques will draw on the current scientific literature.",

    "description" : "Digital gaming is one of the most rapidly developing fields. The effort required for developing games is not trivial. To make a game fun to play, the design of the game levels and/or the AI-driven opponents need to be intelligent and adaptive to the players\u2019 strategies and skills. In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people\u2019s decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players\u2019 experience in games. This course will take the form of a combination of lectures, presentations by students, class discussions, and independent study.",

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions.

We will uncover the role of international trade in air pollution, shifting dirtier industries to countries with lax environmental regulations, creating a cleaner environment via more efficient production, natural resource depletion, alleviating water scarcity, and waste management. With the aid of theory and empirical findings, we will examine the causes and consequences of international trade in the presence of harmful environmental externalities. Finally, we will examine how trade policy, environmental policy, and international environmental agreements can help correct such market failures.",

Similarly, the concept of a \u2018policy,\u2019 high-level guidelines providing a general course of action (or inaction) in a given area, is not new. Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is \u2018open data?\u2019 What does it mean to \u2018share\u2019 data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy? This course takes the basics of policy design and analysis, blends in critical thinking skills, ethics, group dynamics, national perspectives, and international perspectives, and applies it all to the world of big data.",

The course focuses students, early in the year, on attaining knowledge and proficiency in several critical areas they will need to operate effectively as Army officers. These areas include: Coordinate Activities with Staffs, Counseling Theory and Practice within the \u201cArmy Context,\u201d Training Management, and Ethics. While proficiency attained in each of these areas will initially be at the apprentice level, students will continue to sharpen these skills as they perform their roles as cadet officers within the ROTC program and after commissioning. At the end of the course, students should possess the fundamental skills, attributes, and abilities to operate as competent leaders.",

    "description" : "The course focuses on completing the transition from cadet to lieutenant. As a follow-up to the ethics instruction in USAR 4010, the course starts with a foundation in the legal aspects of decision making and leadership. The curriculum reinforces previous instruction on the organization of the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the tactical to the strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and logistical management that will focus on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. At the core of the semester is the Advanced Course Capstone Exercise. This 12-lesson exercise incorporates learning objectives from the entire military science curriculum. The capstone exercise will require students, both individually and collectively, to apply their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by junior officers. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared for the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States Army.",
